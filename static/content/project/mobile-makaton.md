To build a mobile app that can be used for learning, translation and collaboration. There was no apps available to provide a service for people who require Makaton.

Makaton is a unique language programme that uses symbols, signs and speech to enable people to communicate. It supports the development of essential communication skills such as attention and listening, comprehension, memory, recall and organisation of language and expression.

The app has 3 main sections:

Translation section which consists of a word search, via camera, handwritten, keyboard or audio input to be accessible for every user as makaton is commonly used by people with various impairments or disabilities.

Learn section which provides a linear progression path to learning Makaton, targeted at all users with multiple different learning methods.

Profile section which provides a place where a user can set some preferences as well as collaborate with friends, colleagues or students to show off their progression.
