To build a mobile app that can be used both as a nutritional app as well as a budgeting app. Allowing the user to set a weekly budget and a diet to get the best meals for each users preferences.

The app is a recipe builder, creating recipes whilst sticking to a users requirements. These requirements at a high level can be split into financial and nutritional.

The financial requirements allow a user to set a shopping budget as low or as high as they need to, along with the amount of people the budget provides for, this allows users to stick to a shopping budget whilst keeping nutritional value that is populated through artificial intelligence.

The nutritional requirements allow a user to set all nutritional values, either selecting pre-defined common choices, such as balanced, high protein, etc or choosing custom to give full control to the user to cater for every dietary needs.

The goal of the app was to create an app that could be used by someone who doesn't care about their nutrition, all the way to those who are elite athletes, whilst giving the flexibility to those who have dieters requirements such as health conditions, allergies, etc.
