A clock face that will display any selected favourite photos from the users device and shuffle them on the watch screen.

Every time the users screen is activated a new favourite image is displayed at random, allowing a user to create their own backgrounds to their watches.

This is a feature which is available out of the box for Apple smart watches but is not available for Fitbit watches, this clock face makes that same functionality available.
