To govern, create and maintain a design system for Standard Life. Which includes a collection of reusable components, guided by clear standards, that can be assembled together to build any number of applications.

The design system is platform agnostic to be used throughout the vast amount of technology stacks that are currently used, whilst keeping to a browser-compliant and accessible standard.

The design system is made up of 3 parts:

Marketing that provide the concepts that are used to create the brand designs and components.

Guidelines that provide UX and design requirements along with component designs that follow the brand concepts.

Framework that provides the loosely couple building blocks and utilities that create these components.

The outcome of this design system is having a AA accessible, IE 11 browser compliant design system that is fully tested and maintained, allowing a fast and reliable development by any team internal to Standard Life.

The design system, allows for a copy and paste library with the assurance everything is signed off and working as intended, drastically cutting down, resource, cost and effort for any team.
