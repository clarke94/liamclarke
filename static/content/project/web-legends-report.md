To increase site performance and create a native mobile application for a WordPress site for a non-profit charity business.

The Legends Report is the culmination of 10 years of real-life research into human potential with over 10,000 people, conducted by the leadership organisation - Lighthouse International.

The site had become increasingly bloated and needed to be refactored into a better performance site, this started with clearing out unused assets such as images, styling and JavaScript. Followed by an asset optimisation, optimising and minify-ing all assets including css, javascript and images. As a final optimisation, all unnecessary plugins were removed and replaced with bespoke solutions that can be controlled.

During this task, it became apparent there were many security vulnerabilities within the site, so a final cleanse and sanitize of the site to prevent any malicious attacks was performed.

This significantly increased the site performance from around 7 seconds uncached load, to 1.4 seconds uncached load.
