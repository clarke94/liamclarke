The App provides the current weather to anywhere on a map, advancing as far as 7 days ahead. This allows a user to quickly scroll over to an area an check what the weather forecast is for that geographic location.

Depending on the zoom limit depends on what geographic areas are shown, zooming in to finer detail will show forecasts for all small towns close by, and zooming out will provide an overview of that district or area.

Alternatively, the app provides a search feature which allows a user to get straight to where they need to without search on a map.

Selecting an area opens up a detailed weather report of that location, with the ability to scroll through time and date to find upcoming forecasts. All units that are used are easily customisable through the settings which gives full control to the user with the default values being set to where that user is geographically.
